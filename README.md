# Land-Cover-Analysis
This code processes ESA WorldCover data in Google Earth Engine to analyze land cover in the Hirmi Watershed. It classifies and visualizes seven land cover types (tree cover, shrubland, grassland, cropland, built-up areas, bare vegetation, and water bodies), calculates their areas in hectares, and exports results as CSV and GEE assets.
